## 📬 Email Prediction Examples

Below are sample predictions using the trained Naive Bayes Spam Classifier:

| Email Text | Prediction |
|-----------|------------|
| "Congratulations! You won a $500 gift card, click the link to claim now." | **Spam** |
| "Hi John, can we reschedule the meeting to 3 PM tomorrow?" | **Ham (Not Spam)** |
| "Urgent!! Your bank account will be locked. Update your details immediately." | **Spam** |
| "Reminder: Your assignment submission deadline is today." | **Ham (Not Spam)** |

These examples demonstrate how the model classifies real-world messages.
